# stock_prediction-intership-

Here's a code that demonstrates how to use LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to predict stock prices. I'll use a generic structure for this, and you can replace the stock data with any company stock you'd like to analyze.

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
Loading Data: Replace your_stock_data.csv with the path to the CSV file containing stock data. The CSV should have at least a Close column.
Preprocessing: Data is normalized using MinMaxScaler to scale values between 0 and 1, making it easier for the LSTM model to process.
Time Series Data: We create sequences of 60-day closing prices to predict the next dayâ€™s price.
Model Construction: The LSTM model is built using Sequential, containing two LSTM layers with dropout to prevent overfitting.
Training: The model is trained on 80% of the data for 20 epochs with a batch size of 64.
Prediction: The model predicts the stock prices for the test dataset, and the results are plotted.
Make sure to replace the file with actual stock data, and you can tune the hyperparameters for better predictions.

<h3>Funtion</h3>
numpy: For handling numerical data, especially arrays.
pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis (loading and processing the stock data).
matplotlib.pyplot: For visualizing the stock data and predictions.
MinMaxScaler: A tool to normalize data by scaling it between 0 and 1.
Sequential: The base model class from TensorFlow's Keras that allows for building neural networks layer by layer.
LSTM: The Long Short-Term Memory layer, a special kind of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for time series prediction.
Dense: Fully connected layers, used for output in this case.
Dropout: A regularization technique to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to 0 during training.
